A repository for storing Melee Scripts for TASing. Only works for the NTSC-U ISO of Smash Bros. Melee.

## How do you run the script?

You'll need [Dolphin Lua Core](https://github.com/SwareJonge/Dolphin-Lua-Core) to run the script. Once you have the latest version downloaded, follow this path: 

```
Dolphin/
|
| –– Sys/
        |
        | –– Scripts/ (Add Melee_Text.lua and the Melee folder here)
```

You can then run the script in Dolphin by going to Tools -> Execute Script. If the script doesn't appear in the drop-down list, that means `Melee_Text.lua` isn't in the `Sys/Scripts` folder. Otherwise, the script should work as intended. Just remember that the script only works for NTSC-U ISO of the game.

## To-Do

- Add the remaining versions of the game to the repository for more access.
- Add more scripts to make TASing much simpler and efficient.
